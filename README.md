# Online Store Project

A functioning fictitious online single malt whisky store called "Top Shelf Whisky", built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Authentication by Passport.js and online payments made through [Stripe](https://stripe.com).<br>
To make a fake purchase, create a user account with fake information, and use the fake credit card number `4242424242424242`.<br>
